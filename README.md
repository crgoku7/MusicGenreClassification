## Dataset

For the purpose of classification, we have used the GTZAN dataset, a popular benchmark dataset for music genre classification tasks.

The GTZAN dataset consists of 1,000 audio recordings, each 30 seconds long, categorized into 10 distinct music genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock. All audio files are in WAV format with a sampling rate of 22,050 Hz and mono channel.

This dataset provides a well-structured and diverse collection of music genres, making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models for music genre classification.

The dataset can be found here [Data](https://github.com/crgoku7/MusicGenreClassification/tree/main/Data).
## Methodology

We performed the following tasks on our project:
- Feature Extraction with PCA (Principal Component Analysis): We are extracting relevant features from the audio data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA helps reduce dimensionality by identifying the most informative features in the data, which can improve model performance and training efficiency.

- Classification Model Evaluation: To establish a baseline and compare performance, we are training and evaluating several machine learning models on the extracted features. These models include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Adaboost, Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks. Evaluating their accuracy on a validation set will allow us to compare different approaches and find out which model performs the best.
